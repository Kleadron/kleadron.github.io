			<h3>who the hell is kleadron??</h3>
			<div class="grey-box">
				<p>I'm a fool named Aidan, born in 2004. I do gamedev stuff, programming, as well as amature art and music creation. I love old technology.
				<br>
				I primarily know C# and GDScript, but I also know some C, C++, and Lua. C's fun to work in because of how simple it is, albeit tedious.
				<br>
				I've been trying to get into using Godot more, but I still fall back to XNA occasionally just because of how delightfully simple it is to work with (sometimes).

				<p>The bungie halo games are cool.</p>

			<h3>About the website</h3>
			<div class="grey-box">
				<p>I thought it would be fun to make a website in old style. So here it is =]</p>
				<p>This website was designed with the HTML 4.01 specification in mind, so it should at least run on Internet Explorer 5, maybe 4. I've recently tested it with IE11 and Firefox 2.</p>
				<p>Some parts of the website now use HTML5 components for convenience, but should show a fallback on crusty old browsers.</p>
				<p>It will break somewhat if javascript is disabled, since I use that to insert the header and footer.</p>
