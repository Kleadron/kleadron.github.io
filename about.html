				<p>I'm a fool named Aidan and I made a website and I like to mod and pretend I make games.
				<br>
				I know how to program in C# and GDScript, and know some C, C++, and Lua.
				<br>
				XNA Framework is my C# game framework of choice, but Godot is also cool.
				</p>
				<p>The bungie halo games are cool.</p>

			<h3>About the website</h3>
			<div class="grey-box">
				<p>I thought it would be fun to make a website in old style. So here it is =]</p>
				<p>This website is designed with the HTML 4.01 specification in mind, so it should at least run on Internet Explorer 5, maybe 4. If your browser doesn't support it, or javascript, HA. And HOW.</p>
				<p>This is made for a generic resolution of 1024x768.<br>If the website doesn't look right, get a bigger monitor or increase your resolution.</p>
				<p>Some parts of the website now use HTML5 components for convenience, but would still work on crusty old browsers. Since this is hosted on Github, HTTPS is enforced.</p>
