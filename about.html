				<h1>About Kleadron Software</h1>
				<div id="grey-box">
					<p>This is a website.<br>This is <em>Kleadron's</em> website.</p>
					<p>Always being worked on, never complete.</p>

				<h3>who tf is kleadron</h3>
				<div id="grey-box">
					<p>I am some idiot named Aidan Hewitt, and I made a website.</p>
					<p>I like voxel indie games like Astroneer and Murder Miners, and I like the Halo series from CE to reach, 4 and onward are pretty eh. Halo Infinite looks like yummy megablox plastic.
					<br>Halo 3 ODST is my new favorite halo game.</p>
					<p>I'm part of the Murder Miners Hub, and they're pretty cool. Check them out <a target="_blank" href="https://murderminershub.com/">here.</a></p>
				</div>
				<h3>About the website</h3>
				<div id="grey-box">
					<p>This website is designed with the HTML 4.01 specification in mind, so it should at least run on Internet Explorer 5, maybe 4. If your browser doesn't support it, or javascript, HA. And HOW.</p>
					<p>I thought it would be fun to make a website in old style. So here it is =]</p>
					<p>I'm pretty certain this is made for a generic resolution of 1024x768.<br>If the website doesn't look right, get a bigger monitor or increase your resolution.</p>
