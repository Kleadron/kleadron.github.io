				<h3>About the website</h3>
				<div id="grey-box">
					<p>I thought it would be fun to make a website in old style. So here it is =]</p>
					<p>This website is designed with the HTML 4.01 specification in mind, so it should at least run on Internet Explorer 5, maybe 4. If your browser doesn't support it, or javascript, HA. And HOW.</p>
					<p>This is made for a generic resolution of 1024x768.<br>If the website doesn't look right, get a bigger monitor or increase your resolution.</p>
					<p>Some parts of the website now use HTML5 components for convenience, but should still work on bullcrap browsers.</p>
