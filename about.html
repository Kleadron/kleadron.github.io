				<h1>About Kleadron Software</h1>

					<p>Always being worked on, never complete. I keep changing it.</p>

				<h3>who the hell is kleadron??</h3>
				<div id="grey-box">
					<p>I am some idiot named Aidan Hewitt and I made a website and I like to mod/make games.</p>
					<p>I like games like Murder Miners, and the Halo series from CE to Reach.
					<br>Halo 3 ODST is my new favorite halo game.</p>
					<p>I'm part of the Murder Miners Hub, and they're pretty cool. Check them out <a target="_blank" href="https://murderminershub.com/">here.</a></p>
					<p>I am the <em>nice man</em> who helped port FortressCraft Chapter 1 to PC on Steam! Check it out <a target="_blank" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1558210/FortressCraft__Chapter_1/">here!</a></p>

				<h3>About the website</h3>
				<div id="grey-box">
					<p>I thought it would be fun to make a website in old style. So here it is =]</p>
					<p>This website is designed with the HTML 4.01 specification in mind, so it should at least run on Internet Explorer 5, maybe 4. If your browser doesn't support it, or javascript, HA. And HOW.</p>
					<p>This is made for a generic resolution of 1024x768.<br>If the website doesn't look right, get a bigger monitor or increase your resolution.</p>
