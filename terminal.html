					<aside>This is intended for people who think <!--GNU/-->Linux is the best thing ever.</aside>
					<p>Completely ignore or remove the terminal on a computer running the Linux distro Ubuntu, and the same for the command prompt and powershell from a Windows PC.</p>
					<p>Stub your toes for every single time you require the terminal on Ubuntu, to do something you can do on Windows via the GUI.</p>
					<p>Assess the damages and decide if Linux distros really are <em>user friendly.</em></p>
					<p>If you do not have any toes left, or possibly have developed a habit of eating mysterious matter from your foot, consider making Linux distributions a much more user friendly and graphical experience.</p>
