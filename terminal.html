					<aside>This is intended for people who think <!--GNU/-->Linux is the best thing ever.</aside>
					<br>
					<p>Completely ignore or remove the terminal on a computer running the Linux distro Ubuntu, and the same for the command prompt and powershell from a Windows PC.</p>
					<br>
					<p>Stub your toes for every single time you require the terminal on Ubuntu, to do something you can do on Windows via the GUI.</p>
					<br>
					<p>Assess the damages and decide if Linux distros really are <em>user friendly.</em></p>
					<br>
					<p>If you do not have any toes left, or possibly have developed a habit of eating mysterious matter from your foot, consider making Linux distributions a much more user friendly and graphical experience.</p>

				<p>This is satire. <font size="-2">(If you want some of my actual thoughts on linux, view page source below this line.)</font></p>

				<h2>What is this?</h2>
				<div id="grey-box">
					<p>This is trying to make a point that you can't really do everything through GUI on linux yet.</p>
					<br>
					<p>It's mostly satire, but I really don't feel like opening the terminal to change an attribute on a file to make it executable.<br>
					Or maybe I have to build an application from source because no binaries were provided, and everything is missing or broken.</p>
					<br>
					<p>This is also to make the point that Linux is not... "ready" yet. I can't really put my finger on what I mean by this, but the terminal requirement needs to go. Or at least reduced.</p>
					<p>A lot of simple things you can do in the terminal should at least be abstracted out of it. Correctly. <br>
					Linux is annoying for new users. And the terminal is scary! There's a reason why Windows is more popular.</p>
					<br>
					<p>You should not have the feeling of nearly browning your pants when trying to do something as basic as installing custom software, or deleting a file, because you have the fear you might screw up and mis-type a command and lose everything. Most people have no clue what the commands do most of the time and don't want to read the man pages. That's the kind of stuff you read if you're boring.</p>
					<br>
					<p>I don't use Linux very often, so take that as you will. I'm much more used to Windows.</p>
					<p>And if you like using the terminal, that's all fine! Good for you! <em>I don't care!</em></p>
					<br>
					<aside>The Macintosh interface was supposed make computers simpler and easier to use in a sea of command lines.<br>
					Keep that in mind =]</aside>
