					<p>Today we will talk about a character I've invented. I think he is a hate-proof character, you can't hate him for any real reason. You could hate me for creating him though.</p>
					<p>He tries to be nice to everyone and usually has good intentions. <br />Although he isn't perfect, he always tries to fix his mistakes.</p>
					<p>See below</p>

					<ul>
