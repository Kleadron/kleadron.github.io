			<h1>Music Demos</h1>
			<div class="grey-box">
				<p>This is some music I made for a marching cubes voxel game I was working on in 2019-2020. I used OpenMPT and default midi sounds, since I had nothing else to use.</p>

				<p>The first track, intended as main theme. A friend made a remix of it (with much better instruments) when I showed it to them back in 2020;</p>

				<p>It's based off an earlier version of the track, but I still like it.<br>The guy who made it is known as JTRocks55 or Justin Saunders.

				<p>The second main track, I had the idea of it being an underground music track. I wanted to have the bassline from the first one, but someone told me it didn't fit, and I agreed.</p>
