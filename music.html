				<h1>Music Demos</h1>
				<div id="grey-box">
					<p>This is some music I made for a marching cubes voxel game I was working on in 2019-2020. I used OpenMPT and default midi sounds, since I had nothing else to use.</p>

				<h3>dodadodo</h3>

					<audio controls src="resources/music/dodadodo-improved.ogg">
							<a href="resources/music/dodadodo-improved.ogg">Download "dodadodo-improved.ogg"</a>
					</audio>
					<p>The first track, intended as main theme. A friend made a guitar remix of it when I showed it to them back in 2019. Might upload it later.</p>
				</div>
				<h3>underground2 / Deep Beneath</h3>
				<div id="grey-box">
					<audio controls src="resources/music/underground2.ogg">
							<a href="resources/music/dodadodo-improved.ogg">Download "underground2.ogg"</a>
					</audio>
					<p>The second main track, I had the idea of it being an underground music track. I wanted to have the bassline from the first one, but someone told me it didn't fit, and I agreed.</p>
